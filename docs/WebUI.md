# Web UI

The Web UI is by default enabled and reachable under the (configurable) path *&lt;host>/webui*.

- To login you need to specify a valid originator. The default "admin" originator is *CAdmin*.
- Beside of the default *CSEBase* resource you can specify a different resource identifier as the root of the resource tree.
- You can navigate the resource tree with arrow keys.
- You can switch between short and long attribute names (press CTRL-H).


## REST UI

The web UI also provides a REST UI where you can send REST requests directed at resources on the CSE.
